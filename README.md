Paper list for "From Storage to Experience: A Survey on the Evolution of LLM Agent Memory Mechanisms".

## 📖 Introduction
While memory mechanisms have emerged as the architectural cornerstone of LLM agents, current research remains fragmented, oscillating between operating system engineering and cognitive science. This divide prevents a unified view of technological synthesis and a coherent evolutionary perspective.Furthermore, we focus on the key technologies of LLM Agent Memory and define their positions within the evolution path.

To bridge this gap, this repository maintains the paper list for our survey "From Storage to Experience: A Survey on the Evolution of LLM Agent Memory Mechanisms". We propose a novel evolutionary framework that formalizes the development of LLM agents memory into three distinct stages.

This project aims to offer a unified roadmap to help the community architect next-generation LLM Agent Memory systems.

## 🛤️ Evolution Path
1. 💾 Storage (Trajectory Preservation): Focusing on the complete preservation and basic retrieval of raw interaction traces.
2. 🧠 Reflection (Trajectory Refinement): Introducing self-analysis mechanisms to refine and correct original memories through reflection.
3. 🌟 Experience (Trajectory Abstraction): The advanced stage where specific trajectories are distilled into abstract experiences and reusable skills.
