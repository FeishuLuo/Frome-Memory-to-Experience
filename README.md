# Frome-Memory-to-Experience
Paper list for "From Storage to Experience: A Survey on the Evolution of LLM Agent Memory Mechanisms".

## 📖 Introduction
While memory mechanisms have emerged as the architectural cornerstone of LLM agents, current research remains fragmented, oscillating between operating system engineering and cognitive science. This theoretical divide prevents a unified view of technological synthesis and a coherent evolutionary perspective. To bridge this gap, this repository maintains the paper list for our survey: [**"From Storage to Experience: A Survey on the Evolution of LLM Agent Memory Mechanisms"**](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202601.0618). We propose a novel **Evolutionary Framework** that formalizes the development of LLM agent memory into three distinct stages:
1. 💾 **Storage** (Trajectory Preservation): Focusing on the complete preservation and basic retrieval of raw interaction traces.
2. 🧠 **Reflection** (Trajectory Refinement): Introducing analysis mechanisms to refine and correct original memories through reflection.
3. 🌟 **Experience** (Trajectory Abstraction)：Transforming trajectory clusters into experience through cross-trajectory abstraction techniques.

By focusing on these pivotal technologies and their positions within the evolution path, this project aims to offer a unified roadmap to help the community research and design next-generation LLM Agent Memory systems.

## 🛤️ Evolution Path

<p align="center"><i>Figure 1: The Evolutionary path of LLM Agent Memory.</i></p>

Before diving into the evolution of memory mechanisms, we first establish the standard workflow for an LLM Agent integrated with memory. Taking the classic ReAct paradigm as an example, the Agent's decision-making process forms a dynamic closed loop enabled by memory.
During each task execution cycle, the Agent leverages two core capabilities:
1. **Memory Read:** The Agent actively retrieves relevant knowledge from the memory bank to supplement the current context.
2. **Memory Write:** As the task progresses, the generated interaction sequences are recorded as historical trajectories and are written into the memory system in real-time.

Building upon this foundation, we conceptualize the memory mechanism as an evolutionary pathway. This framework is structured into three distinct stages, where each stage is further categorized into three representative paradigms based on their core characteristics.

💾 **Storage**   
Storage serves as the cornerstone of memory evolution, emphasizing the faithful preservation of interaction history. Based on differences in data organization structures, we categorize existing storage mechanisms into the following three types.
1. **Linear Storage**  
     - **Characteristics：** Linear storage treats interaction history as a token stream strictly ordered chronologically.  
     - **Primary Research Directions:** Expanding memory storage capacity through context window adaptation and information sparsification.  
     - **Advantages:** Minimal information loss and maximal logical completeness.  
     - **Limitations:** While ensuring coherence within recent context, early critical information is irreversibly forgotten.
2. **Vector Storage**
     - **Characteristics：** Vector storage encodes interaction trajectories into high-dimensional embedding space.  
     - **Primary Research Directions:** Optimizing retrieval strategies through semantic proximity matching and multi-dimensional weighted scoring that incorporates temporal decay and importance metrics.  
     - **Advantages:** Massive storage capacity.  
     - **Limitations:** High retrieval difficulty and limited memory relevance.
3. **Structured Storage**
     - **Characteristics：** Structured storage utilizes predefined relational structures to preserve interaction trajectories.  
     - **Primary Research Directions:** Leveraging tabular formats for structured queries, implementing tiered memory hierarchies to balance capacity and access speed, and modeling interaction history as topological networks of entities and relations.  
     - **Advantages:** Supports precise operations, logical reasoning, and efficient multi-hop retrieval across structured relationships.  
     - **Limitations:** Requires schema maintenance and lacks flexibility when handling massive interaction trajectories.  

🧠 **Reflection**
The Reflection stage transforms memory from passive recording to active evaluation, utilizing feedback signals to refine memory by correcting errors and reducing noise. Based on the source of reflection signals, we categorize mechanisms into three types.
1. **Introspection**  
     - **Characteristics：** Leverages the LLM agent's internal knowledge to autonomously evaluate and restructure memory.  
     - **Primary Research Directions:** Error rectification through self-critique, dynamic lifecycle management of memory content, and knowledge compression via multi-granularity abstraction.  
     - **Advantages:** Achieves trajectory-level error correction and integration without the need for external feedback.  
     - **Limitations:** Inherent risk of reinforcing model biases or hallucinations.
2. **Environment**  
     - **Characteristics：** Utilizes real-world execution outcomes or environmental feedback as signals for memory refinement.  
     - **Primary Research Directions:** Error rectification through self-critique, dynamic lifecycle management of memory content, and knowledge compression via multi-granularity abstraction.  
     - **Advantages:** Interaction trajectories refined based on facts exhibit greater adaptability to dynamic environments.  
     - **Limitations:** Sparse reward settings and ambiguous execution environments lead to implementation difficulties.
3. **Coordination**  
     - **Characteristics：** Extends reflection to multi-agent collectives by leveraging role specialization and consensus mechanisms.  
     - **Primary Research Directions:** Facilitates the reflection of memory through the construction of societies of heterogeneous agents.  
     - **Advantages:** Reduced hallucination risks and enriched memory perspectives.  
     - **Limitations:** Introduces additional communication overhead and potential memory conflicts across agents.  

🌟 **Experience**
Experience represents the highest cognitive layer, where memory mechanisms compress redundant trajectories into transferable heuristic wisdom through cross-trajectory abstraction. Based on the form of experience representation, we categorize this stage into three types.
1. **Explicit**  
     - **Characteristics：** Explicit experience extracts human-readable, comprehensible, and editable patterns from trajectory clusters.  
     - **Primary Research Directions:** Crystallizing implicit intuition into natural language heuristic guidelines, and encapsulating recurring behavioral patterns into executable procedural primitives.  
     - **Advantages:** Highly interpretable and editable, enabling transparent self-evolution.  
     - **Limitations:** Lacks precision in complex decision boundaries and is prone to conflicting experiences.
2. **Implicit**  
     - **Characteristics：** Implicit experience internalizes interaction histories into model parameters or latent variables.  
     - **Primary Research Directions:** Parameter internalization through fine-tuning techniques that embed trajectory distributions into network weights, and latent modulation that encodes experience into hidden-layer variables dynamically invoked during inference.  
     - **Advantages:** Extremely low retrieval overhead and near-intuitive instantaneous experience.  
     - **Limitations:** Reduced interpretability, high update costs, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting.
3. **Hybrid**
     - **Characteristics：** Hybrid experience establishes a dynamic "accumulate–internalize" cycle, treating explicit experience as a high-capacity cache that is periodically compressed and transferred into implicit model weights.  
     - **Primary Research Directions:** Experience transfer mechanisms that progressively internalize explicit experience repositories through gradient-based updates, combining the interpretability benefits of explicit storage with the efficiency of parameter internalization. 
     - **Advantages:** Balances interpretability with inference efficiency and restricts unbounded memory growth.  
     - **Limitations:** Requires coordination of accumulation and internalization cycles and control of transfer criteria, with potential knowledge degradation during conversion.
