Paper list for "From Storage to Experience: A Survey on the Evolution of LLM Agent Memory Mechanisms".

## 📖 Introduction
While memory mechanisms have emerged as the architectural cornerstone of LLM agents, current research remains fragmented, oscillating between operating system engineering and cognitive science. This theoretical divide prevents a unified view of technological synthesis and a coherent evolutionary perspective. To bridge this gap, this repository maintains the paper list for our survey: [**"From Storage to Experience: A Survey on the Evolution of LLM Agent Memory Mechanisms"**](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202601.0618). We propose a novel **Evolutionary Framework** that formalizes the development of LLM agent memory into three distinct stages:
1. 💾 **Storage** (Trajectory Preservation): Focusing on the complete preservation and basic retrieval of raw interaction traces.
2. 🧠 **Reflection** (Trajectory Refinement): Introducing analysis mechanisms to refine and correct original memories through reflection.
3. 🌟 **Experience** (Trajectory Abstraction)：Transforming trajectory clusters into experience through cross-trajectory abstraction techniques.

By focusing on these pivotal technologies and their positions within the evolution path, this project aims to offer a unified roadmap to help the community research and design next-generation LLM Agent Memory systems.
